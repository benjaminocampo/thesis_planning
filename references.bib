  abstract={In this paper, we discuss Artificial Intelligence (AI) planning and scheduling technology and its application to interferometer configuration and control. Scientific demand and technical requirements necessitate streamlining and optimizing the operation of these instruments. However, it is difficult, often impossible, to achieve this streamlining manually. Moreover, harsh operating environments make manual operation impractical, further motivating the use of automation. We describe the use of the ASPEN automated planning system developed at JPL to demonstrate how planning can be used to perform many operation tasks with many benefits over manual operations. Automated planners can rapidly produce large command sequences. In addition, repairing altered plans is very fast and can be used to respond to unforeseen events.},

abstract = {Digital Interactive Storytelling (DIS) is a relatively novel area of computer entertainment
that aims at investigating interactive applications capable of generating consistent,
emergent, and rich stories. To provide new solutions for DIS, we designed and are
implementing and evaluating a novel multi-agent DIS framework, DIEGESIS, which includes
agents' coordination and new planning and re-planning solutions. In this article,
we discuss the design and implementation of DIEGESIS, explaining in detail the mechanisms
of our planning algorithms, and the story execution and agent coordination algorithms,
along with a planning methods evaluation and agent planning and coordination examples.
We are currently in the process of creating a large DIS scenario, involving the story
of Homer's Troy, with several levels that will allow us to further evaluate and expand
our system.},

abstract = {Most of the robotic systems are designed to move and perform tasks in a variety of environments. Some of these environments are controllable and well-defined, and the tasks to be performed are generally everyday ones. However, exploration missions also enclose hard constraints such as driving vehicles to many locations in a surface of several kilometres to collect and/or analyse interesting samples. Therefore, a critical aspect for the mission is to optimally (or sub-optimally) plan the path that a robot should follow while performing scientific tasks. In this paper, we present up2ta, a new AI planner that interleaves path-planning and task-planning for mobile robotics applications. The planner is the result of integrating a modified PDDL planner with a path-planning algorithm, combining domain-independent heuristics and a domain-specific heuristic for path-planning. Then, up2ta can exploit capabilities of both planners to generate shorter paths while performing scientific tasks in an efficient ordered way. The planner has been tested in two domains: an exploration mission consisting of pictures acquisition, and a more challenging one that includes samples delivering. Also, up2ta has been integrated and tested in a real robotic platform for both domains.}

abstract = {The goal of ubiquitous computing is to create ambience in which one’s experiences
and quality of life are improved by monitoring and assisting people using ubiquitous
technologies and computation in coherence. The continuous advancements of involved
technologies, such as wireless communications, mobile devices, and sensors, imply
fast evolution of ubiquitous computing environments too. The complexity of these environments
is reaching a point where traditional solutions simply no longer work. The environments
are in need of computational techniques that can deal with the evolution and uncertainty
of ubiquitous computing environments dynamically and automatically. Artificial Intelligence
(AI) can contribute towards satisfying this future scenario in many ways, while numerous
approaches inspired by work in the AI planning community have already been designed
for ubiquitous computing. We devote this study to investigate the current progress
of AI planning for ubiquitous computing by analysing those approaches. We rigorously
search for and select relevant literature out of which we extract qualitative information.
Using the extracted qualities, we derive a generic framework that consists of aspects
important to planning for ubiquitous computing. The framework’s main purpose is to
facilitate the understanding of those aspects, and classify the literature according
to them. We then analyse the literature in a consolidated way, and identify future
challenges of planning for ubiquitous computing.},

To do so, most planners rely on a preprocessing stage that computes a grounded representation of the task. Whenever the grounded task is too big to be generated (i.e., whenever this preprocess fails) the instance cannot even be tackled by the actual planner. To address this issue, we introduce a partial grounding approach that grounds only a projection of the task, when complete grounding is not feasible. We propose a guiding mechanism that, for a given domain, identifies the parts of a task that are relevant to find a plan by using off-the-shelf machine learning methods. Our empirical evaluation attests that the approach is capable of solving planning instances that are too big to be fully grounded.&lt;/p&gt;}, number={01}, journal={Proceedings of the AAAI Conference on Artificial Intelligence}, author={Gnad, Daniel and Torralba, Álvaro and Domínguez, Martín and Areces, Carlos and Bustos, Facundo}, year={2019}, month={Jul.}, pages={7602-7609} }
