    system developed at JPL to demonstrate how planning can be used to perform
    many operation tasks with many benefits over manual operations. Automated
    planners can rapidly produce large command sequences. In addition, repairing
    altered plans is very fast and can be used to respond to unforeseen events.},

    Digital Interactive Storytelling (DIS) is a relatively novel area of
    computer entertainment that aims at investigating interactive applications
    capable of generating consistent, emergent, and rich stories. To provide new
    solutions for DIS, we designed and are implementing and evaluating a novel
    multi-agent DIS framework, DIEGESIS, which includes agents' coordination and
    new planning and re-planning solutions. In this article, we discuss the
    design and implementation of DIEGESIS, explaining in detail the mechanisms
    of our planning algorithms, and the story execution and agent coordination
    algorithms, along with a planning methods evaluation and agent planning and
    coordination examples. We are currently in the process of creating a large
    DIS scenario, involving the story of Homer's Troy, with several levels that
    will allow us to further evaluate and expand our system.},

    However, exploration missions also enclose hard constraints such as driving
    vehicles to many locations in a surface of several kilometres to collect
    and/or analyse interesting samples. Therefore, a critical aspect for the
    mission is to optimally (or sub-optimally) plan the path that a robot should
    follow while performing scientific tasks. In this paper, we present up2ta, a
    new AI planner that interleaves path-planning and task-planning for mobile
    robotics applications. The planner is the result of integrating a modified
    PDDL planner with a path-planning algorithm, combining domain-independent
    heuristics and a domain-specific heuristic for path-planning. Then, up2ta
    can exploit capabilities of both planners to generate shorter paths while
    performing scientific tasks in an efficient ordered way. The planner has
    been tested in two domains: an exploration mission consisting of pictures
    acquisition, and a more challenging one that includes samples delivering.
    Also, up2ta has been integrated and tested in a real robotic platform for
    both domains.}

    The goal of ubiquitous computing is to create ambience in which one’s
    experiences and quality of life are improved by monitoring and assisting
    people using ubiquitous technologies and computation in coherence. The
    continuous advancements of involved technologies, such as wireless
    communications, mobile devices, and sensors, imply fast evolution of
    ubiquitous computing environments too. The complexity of these environments
    is reaching a point where traditional solutions simply no longer work. The
    environments are in need of computational techniques that can deal with the
    evolution and uncertainty of ubiquitous computing environments dynamically
    and automatically. Artificial Intelligence (AI) can contribute towards
    satisfying this future scenario in many ways, while numerous approaches
    inspired by work in the AI planning community have already been designed for
    ubiquitous computing. We devote this study to investigate the current
    progress of AI planning for ubiquitous computing by analysing those
    approaches. We rigorously search for and select relevant literature out of
    which we extract qualitative information. Using the extracted qualities, we
    derive a generic framework that consists of aspects important to planning
    for ubiquitous computing. The framework’s main purpose is to facilitate the
    understanding of those aspects, and classify the literature according to
    them. We then analyse the literature in a consolidated way, and identify
    future challenges of planning for ubiquitous computing.},

  abstractNote={&lt;p&gt;Current classical
    planners are very successful in finding (nonoptimal) plans, even for large
    planning instances. To do so, most planners rely on a preprocessing stage
    that computes a grounded representation of the task. Whenever the grounded
    task is too big to be generated (i.e., whenever this preprocess fails) the
    instance cannot even be tackled by the actual planner. To address this
    issue, we introduce a partial grounding approach that grounds only a
    projection of the task, when complete grounding is not feasible. We propose
    a guiding mechanism that, for a given domain, identifies the parts of a task
    that are relevant to find a plan by using off-the-shelf machine learning
    methods. Our empirical evaluation attests that the approach is capable of
    solving planning instances that are too big to be fully
    grounded.&lt;/p&gt;},

  &lt;p&gt; As modeling details can have a large impact on planner perormance,
  domain transformation has been a traditional subject of interest in the
  planning community not only betweenlanguages, but also within languages.
  Herein, we automatean intra-language transformation method that has as yet
  beenapplied only manually, and that has never been formally described: action
  schema splitting, which transforms an actionschema with a big interface (many
  parameters) into severalschemas with smaller interfaces, exponentially
  reducing thenumber of ground actions. We spell out this method, characterizing
  exactly the choice of splits preserving equivalence tothe original schema.
  Making that choice involves a trade-off between interface size and plan
  length, which we explore bydesigning automatic domain optimization methods.
  Our experiments show that these methods can substantially improveperformance
  on domains with large interfaces. &lt;/p&gt; },

  representations for words can be derived through analysis of patterns of
  lexical co-occurrence in large language corpora. Firth (1957) famously
  summarised this principle as “you shall know a word by the company it keeps”.
  We explored whether the same principle could be applied to non-verbal patterns
  of object co-occurrence in natural scenes. We performed latent semantic
  analysis (LSA) on a set of photographed scenes in which all of the objects
  present had been manually labelled. This resulted in a representation of
  objects in a high-dimensional space in which similarity between two objects
  indicated the degree to which they appeared in similar scenes. These
  representations revealed similarities among objects belonging to the same
  taxonomic category (e.g., items of clothing) as well as cross-category
  associations (e.g., between fruits and kitchen utensils). We also compared
  representations generated from this scene dataset with two established methods
  for elucidating semantic representations: (a) a published database of semantic
  features generated verbally by participants and (b) LSA applied to a
  linguistic corpus in the usual fashion. Statistical comparisons of the three
  methods indicated significant association between the structures revealed by
  each method, with the scene dataset displaying greater convergence with
  feature-based representations than did LSA applied to linguistic data. The
  results indicate that information about the conceptual significance of objects
  can be extracted from their patterns of co-occurrence in natural environments,
  opening the possibility for such data to be incorporated into existing models
  of conceptual representation.}
